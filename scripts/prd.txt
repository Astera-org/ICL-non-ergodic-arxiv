# ArXiv Ergodic Component Scaling Experiments - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

This research project aims to investigate how a causal language model's in-context token-level cross entropy (XE) scales with the number of statistically independent ergodic components when total training tokens are held constant. The project involves training language models on different combinations of arXiv sub-categories (components) while keeping the total token count fixed.

## Research Questions

1. How does model performance (measured by cross-entropy) change as we increase the number of independent ergodic components in the training data?
2. What is the relationship between model size, number of components, and performance?
3. Can we quantify how diversifying training data across more domains affects generalization capabilities?

## Key Components

### 1. Dataset Processing

- Use the `ccdv/arxiv-classification` dataset (train/val/test splits)
- Select arXiv sub-categories to serve as independent components:
  - Focus on: cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.SY, cs.CE, cs.PL, cs.IT, cs.DS, cs.NE, math.AC, math.GR, math.ST
  - Analyze dataset to identify the five categories with most data for primary experiments
  - Structure the scaling experiment systematically (e.g., train on smallest category first, then smallest/2 + second-smallest/2, etc.), Make sure each training run goes through the same number of tokens!
- Implement tokenization with an appropriate tokenizer
- Design storage solution for efficient access during training
- Create a dynamic window loader that selects 100-token windows randomly from the training set. A single epoch should go through the entire training set once. And we want to go have 3-5 epochs (to be deterimed).

### 2. Experimental Design

- Determine optimal model size for experiments (balancing computational constraints with research needs)
- Define scaling values (number of components, tokens per component, etc.)
- Establish total token budget to be held constant across all experiments
- Design experiment progression logic (how to combine components, allocation of tokens, etc.)
- Set training parameters (learning rate, batch size, number of epochs [3-5])

### 3. Model Development

- Implement/adapt a causal language model architecture
- Support variable-sized training on different component combinations
- Ensure reproducible training setup (fixed seeds, controlled environments)
- Implement appropriate logging and checkpointing

### 4. Evaluation Framework

- Measure in-context token-level cross entropy across different component combinations
- Design evaluation protocols for each experimental condition
- Create visualization tools for scaling relationships
- Implement statistical analysis for comparing results across conditions

### 5. Infrastructure

- Set up computation environment with appropriate GPU resources
- Implement efficient data loading pipelines
- Design experiment tracking and management system
- Ensure reproducibility of experiments
